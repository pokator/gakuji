This is the front-end for Gakuji, a Japanese language-learning application, using song lyrics to learn kanji and vocabulary.

Gakuji is built using React Native, and currently hosted on Netlify. We're in an alpha testing phase - like, super alpha testing phase. Still working on patching a ton of bugs and issues.

Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss collaboration on this application.
